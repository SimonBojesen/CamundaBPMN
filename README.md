# Book Finder Project
We have chosen to make an application that will integrate the use of 2-3 API's: Google Books API, Goodreads API and possibly Pricerunner.
So we will use Google API as a seach engine for our app.
The user would search for a Title or the name of an Author to find a list of book results.
He/she would then be able to use a goodreads account to read and write bookreviews and follow or unfollow authors.
Finally he or she would be able to find the best price on the specific book via. pricerunner.

### Read for clarity
We had a lot of trouble with Camunda and are still working to improve the result of our workflow.

Therefore we have 2 .bpmn files.
- Exam_BPMN is the file representing the visuel of how we want our workflow to work when we finish it
- BookFinder is the workflow we tried implementing with intelliJ and the Camunda Dashboard on the localhost server.
